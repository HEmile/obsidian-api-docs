# Obsidian API Docs

Welcome to the community-provided documentation of the [[Obsidian API]].

## Getting Started

If this is your first time learning about plugin development for Obsidian, it
is recommended that you browse the [Sample
Plugin](https://github.com/obsidianmd/obsidian-sample-plugin) which
demonstrates how to layout your project and get a basic plugin running.
Additionally, the Sample Plugin can be used as a template to get your project
started.
